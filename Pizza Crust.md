NO-RISE PIZZA CRUST
YIELD: FOUR 9-INCH PIZZAS

INGREDIENTS

1 c. water, heated to 110 degrees (should feel warm to touch, not hot)
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 tbsp. sugar
1 envelope (2 1/4 tsp.) rapid-rise or instant yeast
1 3/4 c. all-purpose flour (or bread flour)
1 c. white whole wheat flour
1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese
1 tsp. sea salt
INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat oven to 450°.
Add water, oil, and sugar in a bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top. Allow yeast to proof for 5 minutes. Yeast should be foamy when ready. (Still weary about yeast? I made a little video for you.)
Pulse flours, parmesan, and salt in food processor until combined.
Add flour mixture into yeast mixture, and stir until combined. Quickly knead dough until it comes together.
Divide dough into four equal parts. On a floured surface, roll out dough into 9-inch rounds. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet.
Add pizza sauce or homemade pesto. Top with veggies and cheese, a dash of salt and pepper, and a splash of olive oil.
Bake for 15-20 minutes.
NOTES

• If you’re not into whole wheat flour, substitute equal parts all-purpose flour.

• This crust seriously tastes best with zero rise time. I’ve allowed it to rise for an hour or so, and it’s always better with zero rise. Truly, you can have your cake and eat it.

• Best tip I could offer—load your pizza up with fresh veggies. You’ll feel far less guilty about eating pizza in the first place.
